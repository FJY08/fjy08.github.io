      - Proposed a signal pruning method for two-dimensional seismic sensing data using edge detection and brightness variation statistics.  
      - Suggested a hypothesis that QUBO optimization difficulty may depend on the Hamming distance between initial state and global optimum, in addition to energy barrier height, and partially validated it on the D-Wave quantum annealer.  
      - Classified the applicability of quantum acceleration for QUBO using a random forest approach.

## About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Junyu Fan. I‚Äôm someone who wants to **bring a bit of science fiction into real life, and use technology to make life better**. I like exploring the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind things, building cool stuff, and sometimes making music. 

In the past few years I‚Äôve been working on quantum error correction, mostly with holographic codes inspired by AdS/CFT, and also did some research on quantum dot qubits. 

For the future, I just want to keep following my curiosity. ‚Äîquestions about the nature of intelligence, quantum computing, etc. One day, I hope to come closer to the answers to these questions.
